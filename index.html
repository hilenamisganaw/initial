  <ham> Cast members perform musical selections at the White House, 2016.
    Lin-Manuel Miranda, Phillipa Soo, Leslie Odom, Jr., and Christopher
    Jackson. Hamilton: An American Musical is a sung- and rapped-through musical
    about the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, with music,
    lyrics, and book by Lin-Manuel Miranda, inspired by the 2004 biography
    Alexander Hamilton by historian Ron Chernow. Incorporating hip-hop, rhythm
    and blues, pop music, soul music, traditional-style show tunes, and
    color-conscious casting of non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and
    other historical figures, the musical achieved both critical
    acclaim and box office success. </ham>
